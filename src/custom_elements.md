# Custom Elements

> This chapter is a WIP

This chapter will guide you through the process of creating a custom element from scratch. This element will render a few shapes and animate them when the user clicks on it or presses a key.

An element in Yarrow is composed of three to four parts: The builder, the element itself, a handle to the element, and (optionally) a style struct for the element.
