# Getting Started

## Installing Rust

The Yarrow framework is built using the Rust programming language. To use Yarrow, you must install the Rust compiler by following the instructions over at [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running the Examples

The [Yarrow repository](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Yarrow) on github contains some [example applications](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Yarrow/tree/main/examples). To run these examples, first clone the repository and enter the root directory of the project in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Yarrow.git
cd Yarrow
```

Then run the following command:

`cargo run --example <name_of_example>`

Where `<name_of_example>` should be replaced with the example name, for example:

`cargo run --example gallery`

> The first compile may take quite a while as it is compiling an entire GUI library from scratch. Subsequent compiles should be much faster.
