# Getting Started

## Installing Rust

The Yarrow framework is built using the Rust programming language. Currently, to use Yarrow, you must install the Rust compiler by following the instructions over at [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running the Examples

The [Yarrow repository](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Yarrow) on github contains some example applications. To run these examples, first clone the repository to a local directory. Then inside a terminal, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

`cargo run --example <name_of_example>`

Where `<name_of_example>` should be replaced with the example name (i.e. `cargo run --example gallery`)
